# KeeperHub Workflow Schema — Reference Guide

This document covers the KeeperHub workflow JSON schema details
that are not fully covered in the official docs. Written during
the KeeperHub Agents Onchain Hackathon by the SentinelLP team.

---

## The critical fields

### `abi` — must be a JSON string, not an array

**Wrong (causes 422 error):**
```json
{
  "abi": [{ "name": "transfer", "type": "function", ... }]
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "abi": "[{\"name\":\"transfer\",\"type\":\"function\",...}]"
}
```

Always `JSON.stringify()` your ABI before putting it in the config.

---

### `functionArgs` — a JSON-stringified positional array

`functionArgs` is a JSON-stringified positional array whose elements
map to the ABI inputs by index.

**Wrong:**
```json
{
  "functionArgs": "[{\"to\":\"0xRecipient\",\"amount\":\"1000000\"}]"
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "functionArgs": "[\"0xRecipient\",\"1000000\"]"
}
```

Note: named-field objects only apply to a single `tuple`/struct
parameter, not as a wrapper for all args.

---

### `tokenConfig` for `web3/approve-token`

`tokenConfig` accepts either a bare `0x`-prefixed token address
(treated as the token address directly) or a JSON string with
the full custom token shape. Both work:

```json
{ "tokenConfig": "0xTokenAddress" }
```

```json
{
  "tokenConfig": "{\"mode\":\"custom\",\"customToken\":{\"address\":\"0xTokenAddress\"}}"
}
```

Note: `symbol` is fetched on-chain; you don't need to provide it.

---

### Deadlines — keep template substitution result valid JSON

Template expressions inside `functionArgs` are supported and
resolve before `JSON.parse`. The rule is: ensure the substituted
result is valid JSON. Computing values like deadlines beforehand
is the safest approach:

```typescript
const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 600;
functionArgs: JSON.stringify([deadline])
```

Avoid arithmetic expressions after substitution
(e.g. `{{timestamp}} + 3600`) as they produce invalid JSON.

---

### `network` — recommended as a string chain ID

A string chain ID is the recommended form:

```json
{ "network": "11155111" }
{ "network": "1" }
```

The API also accepts raw numbers and legacy names like
`"sepolia"` or `"base"` at runtime, but string chain IDs
are the safest and most explicit.

---

### `gasLimitMultiplier` — pass as a string

```json
{ "gasLimitMultiplier": "1.5" }
```

Helps avoid out-of-gas errors on complex transactions.

---

## Endpoint reference

### Create workflow
```
POST /api/workflows/create
```

### Execute workflow
```
POST /api/workflow/{workflowId}/execute
```
or
```
POST /api/workflows/{workflowId}/execute
```
Both routes work identically.

### Get execution status
```
GET /api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/status
```

Returns a `transactionHashes` array in the success payload —
you can read tx hashes directly from the status response
without fetching logs separately.

### Get execution logs
```
GET /api/workflows/executions/{executionId}/logs
```

---

## Node structure

Every node follows this shape (`status` and `description` are optional):

```typescript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  type: "trigger" | "action",
  data: {
    label: "Human readable name",
    type: "trigger" | "action",
    config: { ... },
    // status and description are optional
  }
}
```

---

## Trigger node

```typescript
{
  id: "trigger",
  type: "trigger",
  data: {
    label: "Manual Trigger",
    type: "trigger",
    config: { triggerType: "Manual" },
  }
}
```

Use the capitalized canonical value: `"Manual"`, `"Schedule"`,
`"Webhook"`, `"Event"`, `"Block"`, `"Transfer"`.

---

## Edge structure

```typescript
{
  id: "e1",
  source: "trigger",
  target: "step-1"
}
```

---

## Finding your wallet integration ID

```typescript
const res = await axios.get("https://app.keeperhub.com/api/integrations", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
});
const walletId = res.data[0].id; // bare array, no wrapper
```

---

## Transaction hash location

The workflow execution status endpoint returns `transactionHashes`
directly in the success payload. You can read tx hashes from
the status response without fetching logs:

```typescript
const status = await getExecutionStatus(executionId);
const txHashes = status.transactionHashes;
```

---

## What we found genuinely undocumented

1. `abi` must be `JSON.stringify()`'d — causes a silent 422 if not
2. `gasLimitMultiplier` must be a string, not a number
3. The edge shape (`id`, `source`, `target`) is not in the quickstart
4. The create/status/logs endpoint paths are not in one place in the docs
